# Usage

## Download the dataset
- The paper dataset is stored on the Huggin Face platform, [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ami-iit/paper_latella_2023_irim_muscle-force-estimation_dataset).
- The dataset is already organized as required by the code. You only have to move the dataset folder in your code repository path.


## Run the code
- Open Matlab.
- Browse to the repository.
- Launch the script `launchDataset.m`.
- A dialog box will ask you the number of trial to be inserted.
- The computation will provide:
  - several musculoskeletal quantities estimation plots,
  - a combined visualization of the kinematics of the human right leg and the muscles dynamics contraction.
